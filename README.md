# Mixcloud Plugin for Logitech Squeezbox media server #

This is a Logitech Media Server (LMS) (a.k.a Squeezebox server) plugin to play
tracks from MixCloud. To install copy the Files to the Plugin Directory of the Logitech Media Server
and restart the Server.

After installation, you can configure the Plugin under _Settings_ > _Advanced_ > _MixCloud_

This Plugin is in Alpha stage and build from the SqueezeCloud Plugin(thanks to the developer) , because the documentation
of the LMS Server is very bad and Perl still sucks.
