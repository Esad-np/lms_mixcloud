# Mixcloud Plugin for Logitech Squeezebox media server #

This is a Logitech Media Server (LMS) (a.k.a Squeezebox server) plugin to play
tracks from Mixcloud. To install, use the settings page of Logitech Media server.
Go to the _Plugins_ tab, scroll down to _Third party source_ and select _Mixcloud_.
Press the _Apply_ button and restart LMS.

After installation, you can configure the Plugin under _Settings_ > _Advanced_ > _Mixcloud_

The plugin is included as a default third party resource. It is distributed via my
[personal repository](http://server.vijge.net/squeezebox/) There is no need
to add an additional repository, because this is an official third party repository.
However, if you want to, you can add the repository directly. A new version might be
earlier available in this repository:
    
    https://danielvijge.github.io/lms_mixcloud/public.xml

This Plugin is in Alpha stage and build from the SqueezeCloud Plugin (thanks to the developers), because the documentation
of the LMS Server is very bad and Perl still sucks.
